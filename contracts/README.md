## Setup

1. Install Foundry by following the instructions from [their repository](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation).
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the variables.
3. Install the dependencies by running: `yarn install`. In case there is an error with the commands, run `foundryup` and try them again.

## Build

The default way to build the code is suboptimal but fast, you can run it via:

```bash
yarn build
```

In order to build a more optimized code ([via IR](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/ir-breaking-changes.html#solidity-ir-based-codegen-changes)), run:

```bash
yarn build:optimized
```

## Running tests


In order to run both unit and E2E tests, run:

```bash
yarn test
```

In order to just run unit tests, run:

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

In order to run unit tests and run way more fuzzing than usual (5x), run:

```bash
yarn test:unit:deep
```

In order to just run e2e tests, run:

```bash
yarn test:e2e
```
